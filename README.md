# NEAT

## Introduction

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a popular neuroevolution algorithm, one of the few such algorithms that evolves the architectures of its networks in addition to the weights. For more information, see this research paper: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf.

HyperNEAT is an extension to NEAT that indirectly encodes the weights of the network (called the substrate) with a separate network (called a CPPN, for compositional pattern-producing network). For more information on HyperNEAT, see this website: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/.

Adaptive HyperNEAT is an extension to HyperNEAT which indirectly encodes both the initial weights and an update rule for the weights such that some learning can occur during a network's "lifetime." For more information, see this research paper: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_sab10.pdf.
